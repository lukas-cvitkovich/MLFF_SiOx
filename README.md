# MLFF_SiOx:
This repository contains the interatomic machine learning force field (MLFF) suitable for the dynamic oxidation of silicon. You are free to use the MLFF for scientific/non-commercial use. If you do, please cite [1] and [2] or the according publication in the Journal of Chemical Physics (to be published)

## Usage:
Download both zip files. They are only separated to stay within the file size limit of GitHub.
Then uncompress them and put the resulting .xml files in the same folder (typically the folder where you run your simulation)

### For use in LAMMPS:
Please make sure to install QUIP and link it to LAMMPS.
